# Voter Participation

This package contains an example frontend for displaying real-time voting data using React and Mapbox GL JS.

At runtime, this client joins tiled county geometry to live voter participation data streamed from a server. The counties are styled based on their real-time voter participation value.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick Start

The client is run by the root package's `npm run start` script, which also starts the API server. If you run it without the API server, you will see an unchanging gray map.
